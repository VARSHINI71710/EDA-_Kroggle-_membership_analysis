Kroger’s Membership Analysis
Project Overview

This project is focused on analyzing Kroger customer membership data to uncover patterns in customer behavior, membership adoption, and spending habits. The primary objective is to provide actionable insights that can guide business decisions such as membership marketing strategies, customer retention programs, and targeted promotions.

The analysis spans data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical computations, linear algebra operations, feature engineering, and SQL-like simulations using Pandas. The approach combines practical Python programming, data science methods, and mathematical operations to derive meaningful insights from real-world customer data.

Dataset

Source: Kroger Membership Dataset

Columns:

kroger_id → Unique identifier for each customer

has_member_card → Indicates if the customer holds a Kroger membership ('Y' for yes, NULL or empty if not)

The dataset is relatively simple, but it provides a foundation to explore data cleaning, statistical analysis, feature engineering, and visualization techniques.

Objectives

Understand basic membership patterns and distributions among customers

Clean and preprocess data to ensure accuracy and consistency

Perform exploratory data analysis to visualize and summarize trends

Compute probabilities, mean, median, and mode for membership status

Apply linear algebra and NumPy operations to simulate vector-based computations

Engineer additional features such as membership flags, simulated spending, and discount eligibility

Perform SQL-like queries in Pandas for business-oriented insights

Identify key trends and actionable findings regarding customer membership and spending behavior
